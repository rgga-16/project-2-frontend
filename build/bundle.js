How do people move through it? Are there any areas that feel cramped or awkward?  \n\n            34 \n            00:05:30,000 --\x3e 00:05:40,000 \n            Sarah: I'll take another look at the layout and see if there are any areas that need more space.  \n\n            35 \n            00:05:40,000 --\x3e 00:05:50,000 \n            Student 8: The use of plants is a nice touch. It adds a bit of life to the space.  \n\n            36 \n            00:05:50,000 --\x3e 00:06:00,000 \n            Professor: Yes, but be mindful of maintenance. Some plants require a lot of care. Choose ones that are easy to maintain.  \n\n            37 \n            00:06:00,000 --\x3e 00:06:10,000 \n            Guest Professional 2: And consider the placement of the plants. They should enhance the space, not clutter it.  \n\n            38 \n            00:06:10,000 --\x3e 00:06:20,000 \n            Sarah: I'll make sure to choose low-maintenance plants and place them strategically.  \n\n            39 \n            00:06:20,000 --\x3e 00:06:30,000 \n            Student 9: The overall design feels very cohesive.
